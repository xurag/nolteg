
Only one halogen lamp is used 2 times to have a left and a right variety
Halogen sets and LED sets are ignored completely.

swapped: 46087   46095 png were given wrong names i suppose

As objects that are parent and children at once are not yet supported,
the lamps are attached to the beds.

In real life they are attached to the back rests instead.
